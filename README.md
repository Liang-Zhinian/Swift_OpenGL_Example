# Swift OpenGL Example

This project was developed just for proof of concept: Simple application with OpenGL written on swift - can be compiled and run on Ubuntu (Linux) and OS X. And in future on some X platform. 

### Getting Started

Install swift toolchaine, download from [swift.org](https://swift.org/download/#latest-development-snapshots). Instruction [here](https://swift.org/getting-started/#installing-swift).

###### OS X
1. Clone repository 
2. run `swift build` in terminal or use Xcode project.

###### Linux (Ubuntu)

1. Clone repository
2. Install dependecies packages<br>
`sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libglu1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev`
3. run `swift build`
4. run `.build/debug/app`



### What to learn from code


- Swift Package Manager
- split code on modules
- window with OpenGL context for Linux (X11) on Swift with using C API
- window with OpenGL context for OS X
- extensions
- override operators
- struct, tuple, protocol, ...

### Kind of Conclusion
At beginning of work on example, my expirence with Swift was zero, except that I read a book, ok half book, ok first 15 pages :). I promice, will read it all. 
So, I can sum that even with low knowledges in Swift, but with expirence in C/C++/Objective-C, you can easily develop some basic app like this. 

Also want to say that I do like Swift [Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/#conceptual-overview) and Modules concept.

Don't judge too hard, project was done in 3 evenings. :)
